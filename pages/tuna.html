        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <p><ul>
            <li>2 ahi tuna steaks</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp canola or other light oil</li>
        </ul></p>        
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <p><ol>
            <li>Pat the ahi tuna steaks dry with a paper towel. Place on a plate or inside a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Mix the soy sauce (2 tablespoons), toasted sesame oil (1 tablespoon), honey (1 tablespoon) kosher salt (1/2 teaspoon- OMIT if marinating for more than a couple hours, see notes), pepper (1/4 teaspoon), and cayenne pepper (1/4 teaspoon) until honey is fully dissolved. Pour over the ahi tuna steaks and turn over to coat completely.</li>
            <li>Let marinate for 10 minutes-2 hours.</li>
            <li>Heat a medium skillet (preferably non-stick or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet) on medium-high to high until very hot.</li>
            <li>Add the canola oil (1 tablespoon) to the hot pan. Sear the tuna for 2 minutes on each side for medium rare.</li>
            <li>Remove to a cutting board and allow to rest for at least 3 minutes. Slice into 1/2 inch slices and serve garnished with green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice, if desired.</li>
